# Secret Games Menu Enhancements

## Overview
The secret games menu has been completely redesigned to be more suitable for the 320x240 2.5" display, with a simpler layout inspired by the Pong pause menu.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Preview Images Created
- **New Assets**: Created custom preview images for each game:
  - `game_pong_preview.png` - Shows paddles, center line, and ball
  - `game_breakout_preview.png` - Shows colorful brick layout, paddle, and ball
  - `game_snake_preview.png` - Shows snake body with head and food
  - `game_tetris_preview.png` - Shows tetris pieces and blocks
- **Theme Colors**: All images use the tricorder color scheme (Sickbay Green, Engineering Gold, etc.)
- **Optimized Size**: 64x48 pixel images maintain 4:3 aspect ratio like the display

### 2. Simplified Layout
- **Pause Menu Style**: Now uses a centered overlay similar to the Pong pause menu
- **Background Images**: Preview images are scaled and tiled as background patterns
- **Semi-transparent Overlay**: Dark overlay ensures text readability over backgrounds
- **Proper Margins**: 20px spacing around all edges for better visual breathing room

### 3. Improved Menu Design
- **Larger Menu Items**: 35px height items for better readability
- **Centered Layout**: Menu is centered on screen like pause menus
- **Better Text Fitting**: Menu width adjusted to accommodate full game names
- **Clear Selection**: Highlighted selection with proper contrast colors

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear selection highlighting
- **Intuitive Controls**: Simple navigation with clear control hints
- **Consistent Theming**: Uses tricorder color palette throughout
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes while optimized for 320x240

### 5. Code Simplification
- **Removed Complex Animations**: Eliminated unnecessary visual effects
- **Streamlined Functions**: Simplified drawing functions for better performance
- **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if images fail to load
- **Cleaner Code**: Removed test files and unnecessary complexity

## Files Modified
- `models/menu_manager.py` - Updated to use new preview images
- `ui/views/secret_games_view.py` - Complete redesign with simplified layout
- `scripts/create_game_previews.py` - Script to generate preview images
- `assets/images/` - Added new game preview images

## Technical Details
- **Display Optimization**: Designed specifically for 320x240 resolution
- **Memory Efficient**: Images cached to avoid reloading
- **Error Resilient**: Fallback rendering if images can't be loaded
- **Theme Compliant**: Uses existing color configuration system

The new secret games menu provides a much cleaner, more readable interface that better suits the constraints of a 2.5" display while maintaining the tricorder aesthetic.
